- ~~Rebrand~~ (v1.0.0) — Aegis for Ajax identity
- ~~Binary sensors~~ (partial) — glass_break, vibration, external_contact
- ~~Per-group `alarm_control_panel` for Group/Zone Mode~~ (v1.2.4) — one panel per Ajax security group + whole-house panel for night mode (#84, #86)
- ~~Reauth flow~~ (v1.2.4) — `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` + `async_step_reauth` so HA shows the Reconfigure banner instead of failing silently (#90)
- ~~HA Repairs~~ (v1.2.4) — `hub_offline_24h`, `hts_chronic_failure`, `fcm_credentials_invalid` (with guided fix flow), `grpcio_version_mismatch` Repair cards (#89)
- ~~System Health card~~ (v1.2.4) — gRPC reachability, HTS/FCM ratios, pushes received, last push / last poll ages under Settings → System (#91)
- ~~DHCP discovery~~ (v1.2.4) — Ajax hubs on the LAN appear as Discovered cards via OUI `9C:75:6E` (#92)
- ~~Tilt + Steam binary sensors~~ (v1.2.4) — `tilt` on DoorProtect Plus family (accelerometer), `steam` on FireProtect 2 smoke-chamber variants (steam-vs-smoke discriminator) (#101)
- ~~Lock platform~~ (v1.2.4) — `lock.py` with `AjaxLock` for `smart_lock` / `smart_lock_yale` device types. State (locked / unlocked / unlatched) parsed from the `smart_lock` LockStatus oneof; `lock` / `unlock` / HA's `lock.open` (= unlatch) wired to `SwitchSmartLockService` (#102)
- ~~Device commands wired up~~ (v1.2.4) — `DevicesApi.send_command` no longer raises `NotImplementedError`; relays / sockets / wall switches act on the hub via `DeviceCommandDeviceOn` / `DeviceCommandDeviceOff`, dimmer brightness via `DeviceCommandBrightness`. Was a placeholder since v1.0. (#105)
- ~~Switch state read-back~~ (v1.2.4) — `parse_device` now walks `LightHubDevice.spread_properties` for `RelayChannel` / `LightSwitchChannel` / `SocketBaseChannel` so `AjaxSwitch.is_on` reflects the actual hub state. Fixes the bistable Relay Jeweller symptom where the entity always read `False`. (#109)
- ~~System Health diagnostics~~ (v1.2.4) — `last_update_success_time` exposed on the coordinator so the card stops rendering as `error: unknown` (#106); `Reach Ajax cloud (gRPC host)` derived from poll freshness instead of an HTTPS HEAD probe that always returned `unreachable` (#110)
- ~~Non-blocking startup~~ (v1.2.4) — HTS connect-then-listen and FCM startup move to background tasks; first refresh no longer awaits multi-second listener startups so the integration drops out of HA's *"integration taking too long"* warning much sooner (#113, closes #112)
- ~~Cached-snapshot warm start~~ (v1.2.4) — first `_async_update_data` warm-starts `coordinator.devices` from a per-entry `Store`-backed cache and skips the synchronous `get_devices_snapshot` loop on subsequent boots; persistent streams deliver fresh data within seconds. Cache writes from the stream callback go through `Store.async_delay_save` (30 s window) to coalesce bursts. Real-HA measurement: ~10 s shaved off HA total boot, ~9 s off aegis_ajax setup-to-platforms-online (#116, closes #114)
- ~~Valve platform (read-only)~~ (v1.3.0) — `WaterStopChannel.state` / `is_transitioning` / `MALFUNCTION_IS_STUCK` surfaced via the existing `spread_properties` walker as `valve_chN` / `_transitioning` / `_stuck` keys; new `valve.py` exposes them as native HA `valve.*` entities for `water_stop` and `water_stop_base` device types. Bidirectional control still waits on capturing the official app's command-side calls (no `SwitchWaterStopService` in v3 protos) (#117)
- ~~WallSwitch / Socket electrical readings~~ (v1.4.0) — `sensor.<name>_current` (A), `sensor.<name>_voltage` (V, beta.3+), `sensor.<name>_energy_consumed` (kWh, ties into HA Energy dashboard with `total_increasing`), and `sensor.<name>_power_derived` (W, disabled by default, uses the device-reported voltage when present and falls back to `NOMINAL_GRID_VOLTAGE_V` otherwise). Per-device delta pushes from the hub are consumed in place, with merge semantics so partial updates don't blank the cached readings on every relay toggle (#123, #137, #140, beta.3 partial-update fix in #140)
- ~~"Delete FCM credentials" toggle in options flow~~ (v1.4.0) — explicit boolean that drops the four FCM keys from `entry.data` unconditionally, plus a switch from `default=` to `description={"suggested_value": ...}` so the form fields actually round-trip an empty submission instead of restoring the prior value. Two iterations: #139 fixed the persistence handler, #141 fixed the form schema after Hansontech190 reported the password field couldn't be cleared through the UI (#138, #139, #141)
- ~~Parser hardening~~ (v1.3.0-beta.7) — `_parse_statuses` sub-message branches now build inputs with real `LightDeviceStatus(...)` instances instead of `MagicMock` (sweep across signal_strength, gsm_status, sim_status, monitoring, life_quality, temperature, wire_input_status, transmitter_status, smart_lock, nfc, motion_detected); per-device / per-update `try/except` in `_run_stream` so one bad device or update no longer kills the stream; `TestSnapshotReplay` deserialises a real `StreamLightDevicesResponse` and replays it end-to-end, with auto-replay over every `tests/fixtures/*.bin` (#126, #127, follow-up to #119)
- ~~Read-only `update.<hub>_firmware` entity~~ (v1.4.0) — surfaces the pending hub firmware update from `streamHubObject` (field 201 `system_firmware_update`). No `INSTALL` feature declared, `async_install` not implemented even though `Start*FirmwareUpdate` RPCs exist in the protos — firmware updates remain Ajax-scheduled and the integration is purely informational. `installed_version` returns a constant placeholder ("current") because Ajax doesn't expose the installed version to clients; `latest_version` mirrors it when no update is queued and reflects the target version when one is. `release_summary` clarifies the semantic gap in the entity detail panel ("Up-to-date" means "no update queued", not "running latest"). **11th HA platform.** Three iterations: beta.5 shipped, beta.6 fixed the `unknown` rendering, beta.7 added the release_summary (#142, #143, #144)
- ~~`RestoreSensor` on electrical readings~~ (v1.4.0) — the four sensor classes (`current`, `voltage`, `energy_consumed`, `power_derived`) now extend `RestoreSensor` so they survive HA restarts. Bruno's hub doesn't include readings in the boot snapshot — only in change-deltas — so for constant loads the sensors went `unknown` for hours after every restart. With this in place, they fall back to the last persisted value until a fresh delta arrives. Caveat: only restores numeric values; if the previous shutdown had the sensor in `unknown`, there's nothing to restore until a delta fires (#144, #123)

## Priority 1 — High impact, moderate effort

- ~~Preserve HTS-cached state on transient reconnects~~ (`1.4.1`) — `_handle_hts_disconnect` no longer wipes `device_readings` or `hub_network`. The four electrical-reading sensors plus the diagnostic hub-network sensors (IP, SSID, DNS, signal level, ethernet/wifi/gsm channel flags) keep rendering the last value through the dropout and refresh in place on the next delta. `binary_sensor.<hub>_alimentacion_externa` is the deliberate exception: it ANDs `available` with the new `coordinator.is_hts_alive` property so a real hub-power loss during the outage isn't silenced by a cached `on` snapshot. Scope expanded from the original one-liner after the symmetry argument — the hub remembers its own network state across our socket outage the same way it remembers per-device readings (#146).
- ~~"(derived)" suffix on `power_derived` label~~ (`1.4.2`) — stripped across all 14 locales after @brunovdw68 asked in #123. `translation_key` and `unique_id` kept so zero migration impact. Computation (`current × voltage` with 230V fallback) unchanged.
- ~~Options flow doesn't restart FCM client on credential save~~ (`1.4.3`) — `await async_reload` explicitly after `async_update_entry(data=new_data)` instead of relying on the update-listener that doesn't fire when `options` round-trip identical. Mirrors the repair-flow pattern. Reported by @ArshSoni in #148.
- ~~CRA-connection sensor regressed on cobranded installs~~ (`1.4.4`) — `binary_sensor.<hub>_conexion_cra` reads `hub.statuses["monitoring_active"]` first (matches Ajax app's "Conectada" row); falls back to `space.has_monitoring` only when the hub firmware doesn't emit a `monitoring` status oneof. Reverts the primary-source switch from PR #78 / `1.2.3-beta.1` that broke every install without an APPROVED `MonitoringCompany` entry in the snapshot. Caught by Basi against bvis-home; no external issue.
- ~~Cryptic "Invalid handler specified" on duplicate-protobuf-descriptor failure~~ (`1.4.5`) — `__init__.py` now catches the `TypeError("Couldn't build proto file into descriptor pool: duplicate file name …")` raised by `_descriptor_pool.AddSerializedFile`, logs an `ERROR` that spells out the remediation (stale `aegis_ajax*` folder in `custom_components/`), and re-raises. Reported by @mschev in #151.
- ~~CRA company name diagnostic sensor stuck on `unknown` after `1.2.3`~~ (`1.5.0-beta.1`, ships the underlying fix that was first staged as `1.4.6`) — `sensor.<hub>_compania_cra` rendered `unknown` (and the `approved_companies` / `pending_*_companies` attributes were empty) despite the Ajax app showing an approved CRA company. Empirical reproduction: the Ajax server gates `SpaceService.stream.monitoring_companies` (and `installation_companies`) on the `client-version-major` header — `3.46` returns 0 entries, `3.30` returns the full list. Pinned `CLIENT_VERSION` back to `3.30` (and `CLIENT_DEVICE_MODEL` to `SM-A536B`), HTS `build_connect_request` defaults moved in lockstep. Reported by @bogar in #154. See `docs/internal/2026-05-18-client-version-gates-monitoring-companies.md` for the experiment.
- ~~`sensor.<hub>_compania_cra` shows `"multiple"` when more than one company is approved~~ (`1.5.0-beta.1`) — state now renders the alphabetically-sorted joined names (`"EXPANSIVA, PROTEGIM"`), with a `"N companies"` overflow fallback if the joined form would exceed HA's 255-char state limit (vanishingly unlikely with real CRA company names). Attrs unchanged.
- ~~Photo on Demand mode HA service~~ (`1.5.0-beta.1`) — new `aegis_ajax.set_photo_on_demand_mode` with two optional `user` / `scenario` booleans. Wraps `DeviceCommandPhotoOnDemandModeService` (one RPC per oneof leaf supplied; idempotent). Translations in all 14 locales. (#157)
- ~~CRA company name resolver foundation~~ (`1.5.0-beta.1`) — `SpacesApi.get_monitoring_company(space_id, hex_id)` wraps `SpaceMonitoringCompanyService.getMonitoringCompany`, and `get_space_snapshot` uses it to fill missing names on companies that ship without one. Forward-compatible building block for eventually lifting the `CLIENT_VERSION` pin without losing the diagnostic. (#159)
- ~~SmartLock doorbell event~~ (`1.5.0-beta.2`) — fourth qualifier walker pass in `_extract_event_with_compiled_protos` for `SmartLockEventQualifier`; closes the last of the three Ajax doorbell SKUs (Wireless DoorBell / MotionCam Video Doorbell / SmartLock with integrated ring button). Same `event_type: doorbell_pressed` surface across all three, no new device-type registration needed (SmartLock variants already mapped to `lock` entities since `1.2.4`). End-to-end confirmation of Path A (Wireless DoorBell, the hub-level path that shipped in `1.4.5`) arrived from @Sven2410 on 2026-05-20 — first real-hardware verification of any doorbell path. (#158, #160)
- ~~Per-group `alarm_control_panel` reacts to FCM push~~ (`1.5.0-beta.3`) — seven `space_group_*` SpaceEventTag variants map to a new `RAW_TAG_TO_GROUP_SECURITY_STATE`, dispatched through `AjaxCobrandedCoordinator.apply_push_group_security_state(space_id, group_id, new_state)`. `group_id` resolved from a new `_extract_space_source_info` scan that decodes `SpaceNotificationSource` and recognises `type=GROUP`. Space-level state intentionally not touched on group events — arming one group doesn't imply the whole space is armed, and the next poll resolves that. Reported by @ArshSoni in #148. (#161)
- ~~Diagnostics + parser observability~~ (`1.5.0-beta.4`) — `diagnostics.py` `spaces` block now emits `groups: [{id, name, security_state}]` and `group_mode_enabled` so the per-group state visible to the integration is recoverable from a Download Diagnostics dump; `notification.py::_parse_and_fire_event` logs `Push event parsed: event_type=… raw_tag=… group_id=…` at DEBUG immediately after the parser resolves a payload. Closes the two diagnostic blind spots that came up while triaging #148. (#164)
- ~~Event parser resolves by tag priority, not pass order~~ (`1.5.0-beta.5`) — when Ajax bundles a sensor-trip qualifier (`HubEventQualifier(motion_detected)`, `door_opened`, `tamper_opened`, `intrusion_alarm`, …) together with the surrounding state-context qualifier (`SpaceEventQualifier(space_night_mode_on)`, etc.) in the same push, the integration used to render the event as `event_type: arm_night` because the first parser pass returned on the state-context. New `TAG_PRIORITY` table in `const.py` scores every match by semantic weight (confirmed incidents > critical detectors > sensor activity > user-driven state transitions); the highest tier wins. Sensor activations during armed states now surface with the right event_type (`motion`, `door_open`, `doorbell_pressed`, `tamper`, `alarm`, …), with the original tag preserved on `raw_tag`. Pure arm / disarm pushes unchanged. Driven by the real false-alarm event on bvis-home where three sensor trips all rendered as `arm_night`. (#165)

### 1.0 Valve Platform (`valve.py`) — bidirectional control
**Why:** Read-only valve entity shipped in `1.3.0` (#117). The remaining gap is **opening / closing the valve from HA** — automations can react to the valve being closed by a leak, but can't trigger the shut-off themselves nor reopen after a false-positive.

**Status:** Blocked on protocol capture. There is no `SwitchWaterStopService` in the v3 protos we have. Need someone with a WaterStop to run the rig (Frida + mitmproxy on the official mobile app) and capture the gRPC call the app makes when toggling the valve from its UI.

**Effort:** Unknown — likely 2-3 h once the wire shape is in hand.

---

## Priority 2 — Medium impact, moderate effort

### 2.1 Per-device firmware update entities
**Why:** Hub-level firmware update entity shipped in `1.4.0-beta.5`. The same `streamHubObject` snapshot also exposes per-device firmware updates (field 200 `DeviceFirmwareUpdates`), which would surface as `update.<device>_firmware` entities — useful for installs with many devices on different firmware versions.

**Effort:** Low-medium (2-3 h). Same read-only-by-design pattern as the hub entity. Per-device entities should be disabled-by-default (typical install has 10-30 devices and most users won't care which sensor is on which firmware unless one is failing).

**Data source:** `HubObject.device_firmware_updates.device_firmware_update[]`, each entry carries `device_id`, `is_critical` (`BoolValue`), and a `Status` oneof with the full `not_started` / `downloading[%]` / `downloaded` / `installing` / `completed` / `failed` cycle.

### 2.2 Persistent Notification Service
**Why:** Show alarm events as HA persistent notifications with configurable filters.

**Effort:** Medium (2 hours).

---

## Priority 3 — Nice to have, higher effort

### 3.1 Number/Select Platforms
**Why:** Expose configurable device settings (shock sensitivity, LED brightness, etc.)

**Data source:** Requires `UpdateHubDeviceService` gRPC.

**Effort:** High (4-5 hours each).

### 3.2 Device Tracker (`device_tracker.py`)
**Why:** Show hub location on HA map from geoFence coordinates.

**Effort:** Low (1-2 hours) if data is available.

### 3.3 Device Handler Architecture Refactor
**Why:** Per-device-type handler pattern instead of monolithic `_DEVICE_TYPE_SENSORS` dict.

**Effort:** High (6-8 hours). Should be done when adding new entity types.

---

## Known Limitations

These are protocol-level limitations that cannot be resolved:

- **Hub tamper (lid) real state** — status exists in proto but server doesn't send it in `StreamLightDevices`
- **Photo on-demand URL retrieval** — v2 capture works but photo URL via v3 detection area stream returns `permission_denied`
- **SpaceControl keyfob listing** — keyfobs don't appear in `StreamLightDevices`
- **Motion detection when disarmed** — Ajax firmware disables motion reporting when disarmed (battery conservation)
- **Shock/vibration as persistent sensor** — these are alarm events, not persistent statuses
